-- Simple parallel combinators. Since we need to control our dependency
-- surface, our current approach to parallelism is very simple: given the
-- worker thread pool capacity @c@ and the list of tasks to be performed,
-- 'parallelFoldMap' pins exactly @c@ threads on each of the capabilities, lets
-- them consume the input concurrently, and gathers the results using their
-- 'Monoid' instance. Notice that this behavior is deterministic only if '<>'
-- is also symmetric (not only associative), but that is sufficient for our
-- usecases.
--
-- To avoid needless threading overhead, if @c = 1@ them we fall back to the
-- sequential implementation.
